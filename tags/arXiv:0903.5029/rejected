 contribution to the advancement of the subject. Your paper has therefore
 been withdrawn from consideration.
 

===Commentary: Yeah. Upon some reflection, I wouldn't publish this shit either.


 I would like to thank you for your interest in Journal of Physics B:

 Time-of-flight signatures of two bosons in a double well - Dr A Roy et al
 ID: B/318253/PAP
 SECOND REFEREE'S REPORT
 ============================
 In this work the authors calculate the eigensystem of a system of
 two bosons held in a double-well potential, and then make an approximate
 treatment of what the time of flight images of some of these states
 would look like. This would correspond to an experimental procedure
 in which such a system is excited by STIRAP from the ground state to
 a particular higher level, which is then imaged using conventional
 TOF fluoresence.
 
 Although this should be a quite straightforward subject to tackle, after
 reading the paper I am not sure what the authors' objectives were, and
 still
 less, if they actually managed to achieve them. The abstract speaks
 of understanding the "chaotic dynamics of coherent quantum controlled
 excitations of trapped bosons", but it is unclear to me how chaos enters
 the picture. 

===Commentary: Perhaps I should have emphasized that he should RTFP the double well paper. I think I did. 
===Commentary: Although Reichl DID point out that the "chaos" only enters in a VERY indirect way. Perhaps one can remove all mention of chaos, STIRAP, or anything  from this paper, since it's not central.

It is quite clear that altering the interaction strength
 will cause the system to evolve from a single particle picture to a
 strongly correlated (Tonks) state. As a result the form of the
 eigenfunctions
 will change, and so the TOF images will also alter. But I do not see
 that the TOF images presented in the paper really convincingly distinguish
 between the two regimes. 


===Commentary: There was en error in the earlier versions of the numerics (since corrected). The error had inadvertently made a clearer difference betwn the sp and tonks regimes. After correction, the distinction is more subtle (the sd of the tof dist is higher for the tonks regime). Plotting in a semi-log scale will make the Fermi-ish nature of the distribution more clear.

As the authors also do not model the STIRAP
 process itself, but just directly treat the eigenstates, I do not see
 why their results say anything about dynamical processes in general, or
 chaos in particular.
 
 I found the material in the Introduction to be quite confused, and to
 give a general impression of a lack of attention to detail. In the first
 line the authors write that cold bosonic systems have received
 considerable attention over the past three decades. I would say that
 the attention really escalated in the mid 1990s with advances in laser
 cooling, making the timespan more like one decade, which is supported by
 the dates of Refs.1-4. 

===Commentary: This seems like a valid criticism. Good thing I didn't put "three decades" in my dissertation, or in any other paper (phew). However, I was trying to convey that cold atom research goes back to all that Balytkin and Letokhov stuff back in the 70s. Maybe I should have cited them too.

The authors then mention "quantum many-body
 culling", while citing Ref.5, without explaining what it is. 

===Commentary:Drat! Missed that!


The next sentence then
 repeats the same information, while citing Ref.7. The second paragraph
 is equally confusing. It is my impression that random matrix theory treats
 the statistical properties of a large number of energy levels, and has
 little to say about the presence of individual crossings or avoided
 crossings in the Floquet spectrum. The paper is largely concerned with
 a handful of low-lying eigenstates of the system and I do not
 see a priori why they should be connected with the chaotic properties
 of the underlying classical system.


===Commentary: In this case, reviewer is dead wrong. There is a clear correlation between statistical properties of energy levels, avoided crossings, and classical chaos. See our double well paper, Ben's papers, and Reichl's book on Transitions to Chaos for further information.
 

 The discussion given in Section 2 and the first part of Section 3 is
 adequate, but from page 10 I lose the thread of the authors' argument.
 By numerical techniques the authors obtain the low-lying eigenstates
 of the system, and they wish to investigate how this is revealed in
 time of flight images Surely this could also be done directly by numerical
 means? 

===Commentary: Sure. So can any doable problem. What's his point, anyways?


Instead it appears that the eigenfunctions are parameterized by
 set of overlapping Gaussians, each centered on a peak in the distribution.
 The authors do not say why they adopt this procedure, and in truth I
 do not see why it gives any advantage; the algebraic results that they give
 are sufficiently complicated that it is not particularly simple to
 derive any kind of general behavior.

===Commentary: The reviewer doesn't know distribution theory, apparently. Perhaps I should generalize the treatment using formal expressions of tempered distributions. See Tulsi Dass's book for this.
 
 For this reason I am not sure what to make of Fig.5, and the authors give
 little commentary on it. It would appear that higher excited states
 give distributions with more oscillations. Is that the information content
 of the figure? I also note that in the caption it is stated that "only
 the positive half" of the distribution is shown, but in my copy both
 negative and positive halves are plotted.
 
===Commentary: Oops.

 Fig.6 is discussed in more detail, and the authors claim that "the number
 of distinct oscillations correpond to the number of distinct pairs of
 peaks seen in the wavefunctions". This is at least a quantitative
 statement,
 but given that the distributions were calculated by first locating the
 positions of the peaks of the wavefunctions, it does not seem to constitute
 an
 independent test of this statement. For this, it would be necessary
 to fully calculate the time of flight image, and then use the peak
 criterion
 to analyse the structure. I also find the penultimate paragraph of this
 section to be deeply unconvincing. As far as I can see, the authors simply
 compute what the time of flight image of |E4> and |E7> are, and so
 details of the process that created them ("crossing or avoiding a chaos
 assisted adiabatic passage") would seem to be irrelevant. 


===Commentary: Unfortunately, reviewer is right. This is the paper's greatest weakness, and deems it unworthy of publication :-(.

Possibly I simply
 do not see what the authors are trying to argue here. Explaining that
 "the extra oscillation in Fig.6c compared to Fig.6b" to be caused by chaos
 in the underlying classical dynamics definitely requires more explanation
 and/or analysis.

===Commentary: Is there any other way to go to this state?
 
 In summary, I do not believe that the paper is publishable in its current
 form. The results are presented in a rather confusing way, and I do not
 see that they support the authors' conclusions. In particular, I do not see
 how chaos plays a role in determining the TOF images.

 Time-of-flight signatures of two bosons in a double well - Dr A Roy et al
 ID: B/318253/PAP
 FIRST REFEREE'S REPORT
 ============================
 The authors consider two interacting bosons in a double-well potential.
 They
 find eigenstates of the system by numerical diagonalization of the
 Hamiltonian
 and perform an analysis of time of flight behavior of two bosons.
 
 In my opinion the manuscript presents results which can constitute
 exercises
 for advanced students but there is little that can be considered as a high
 quality research deserved to be published in a scientific journal.

 In Sec.3 the authors show analytical analysis of the time-of-flight
 effects. In
 eq.(16) values of a_i are unknown. In Sec.4 they describe results of
 numerical
 simulations but they do not present any test of the analytical predictions
 shown in Sec.3.
 
 I do not recommend the manuscript for publication in JPB.


===Commentary: Overall, the reviewer's response is an expected one. I wasn't expecting acceptance on account of the papers' most glaring weakness. It's basically just a witty little problem that Mark Raizen told me to do on a whim (then changed his mind).
